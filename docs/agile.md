# Agile

Always start by considering a challenge from an Agile perspective.
Also, What are the goals? Who are the stakeholders?

## Goals

As the developer I want to deliver a working piece of software  
Which demonstrates who I am as a coder So that it can be evaluated.

## Stakeholders

- *JavaScript Developer*

Me. My role is to deliver a solution in the form of a Github repo
which can be analysed by the Agile Coach to see whether my approach
is likely to be a suitable fit.

```
    As a consultant I need to be able to document my process clearly  
    So that clients can see value
```

- *Product Owner*

Is the representative of the business that will use the app.  
In this case we are imagining an event organiser with no previous  
software dev or agile experience.

- *Agile Coach*
