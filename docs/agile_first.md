## [Tennis Challenge Sydney](./index.md)

# Agile First

We always start by considering this challenge from an Agile perspective.
What are the goals? Who are the stakeholders? What are the parameters?

## Goals

As a developer I want to deliver a working piece of software Which demonstrates who I am as a coder So that DiUS can evaluate it.

## Stakeholders

- *Product Owner*

Is the representative of the business that will use the app. In this case we are imagining an event organiser with no previous
software dev or agil experience.

- *JavaScript Developer*

Me. My role is to deliver a solution in the form of a Github repo
which can be analysed by the Agile Coach to see whether my approach
is likely to be a suitable fit to DiUS

As a consultant I need to be able to document my process  
clearly so that clients can see the value that is being added.

Because this challenge is delivered as a github repo,  
it makes sense to use GitHub Pages to take care of this for us.

All we need do is create a few files in a ```/docs``` folder,  
commit the new file and we're good to go.
