## Hello

Hello, I'm Chris.  
I've been contracting under the name *listingslab* for 10 years  
It's easier to rank in Google for 'listingslab' than 'chris'. 

## Begin Docs

As a consultant I need to be able to document my process  
clearly so that clients can see the value that is being added.

Because this challenge is delivered as a github repo,  
it makes sense to use GitHub Pages to take care of this for us.

All we need do is create a few files in a ```/docs``` folder,  
commit the new file and we're good to go.
