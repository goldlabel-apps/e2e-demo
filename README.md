We will start by considering this challenge from an Agile perspective.  
What are the goals? Who are the stakeholders? What are the parameters?

## Goals

As a developer I want to deliver a working piece of software
Which demonstrates who I am as a coder
So that DiUS can evaluate it.

## Stakeholders  

*Product Owner*  

Is the representative of the business that will use the app. 
In this case we are imagining an event organiser with no previous  
software dev or agil experience.

*JavaScript Developer*

Me. My role is to deliver a solution in the form of a Github repo  
which can be analysed by the Agile Coach to see whether my approach  
is likely to be a suitable fit to DiUS

*Agile Coach*

## Parameters

Let's aim to have the excersise completed within three hours. Go.
